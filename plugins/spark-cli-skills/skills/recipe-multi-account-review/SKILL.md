# Recipe: Multi-Account Review

For users with multiple email accounts, review each account's inbox status and present a unified summary with per-account breakdown.

**Prerequisite:** Read the `use-spark` base skill for command reference and filter syntax.

**Access level required:** read-only.

## Steps

### Step 1: Discover all accounts

```bash
spark accounts
```

Note each account email, its access level, and associated calendars and teams.

### Step 2: Check folders per account

For each account, see the folder structure and message counts:

```bash
spark folders user@work.com
spark folders user@personal.com
spark folders user@sideproject.com
```

### Step 3: Review unread mail per account

For each account, check unread across key categories:

```bash
spark emails user@work.com --filter "is:unread"
spark emails user@personal.com --filter "is:unread"
spark emails user@sideproject.com --filter "is:unread"
```

For a category-level breakdown on the most active account:

```bash
spark emails user@work.com --filter "category:priority is:unread"
spark emails user@work.com --filter "category:personal is:unread"
```

### Step 4: Cross-account priority check

Check priority mail across all accounts at once:

```bash
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:priority is:unread"
```

This uses the unified inbox to surface priority items regardless of which account received them.

### Step 5: Present the summary

Report per account:
- **work@company.com:** N unread (X priority, Y people)
- **personal@gmail.com:** M unread
- **side@project.com:** K unread

Highlight cross-account priorities and any account that needs immediate attention.

## Tips

- Start with `spark accounts` to discover all configured accounts and their access levels.
- The unified inbox (`spark emails Inbox`) aggregates across all accounts - use it for cross-account priority checks.
- Per-account browsing (`spark emails user@example.com`) keeps things separated when the user wants to focus on one context.
- Use `spark folders <account>` to understand each account's folder structure before browsing specific folders.
- Some accounts may be read-only while others have triage access. `accounts` shows the access level for each.
- For users with work + personal accounts, suggest processing them separately to maintain mental context.
- Combine with `recipe-inbox-by-category` for a deep dive into the most active account.
