# Recipe: Invitation Manager

Process pending calendar invitations by checking availability for each and presenting a decision list with recommendations.

**Prerequisite:** Read the `use-spark` base skill for command reference and filter syntax.

**Access level required:** read-only.

## Steps

### Step 1: List pending invitations

```bash
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:invitation"
```

Collect all pending invitations. Note the senders, subjects, and IDs.

### Step 2: Read each invitation

For each invitation, read the thread to understand the meeting details:

```bash
spark thread <id>
```

Note the proposed time, attendees, and purpose.

### Step 3: Check availability for each

For each invitation's proposed time, check whether the user is free:

```bash
spark events --today
```

Or for a specific date range:

```bash
spark events --start 2026-04-14 --end 2026-04-14
```

For a broader view:

```bash
spark availability --start 2026-04-14 --end 2026-04-14
```

### Step 4: Present a decision list

Summarize each invitation with a recommendation:

- **Accept** - the user is free at the proposed time
- **Conflict** - the user has an overlapping event (name the conflict)
- **Needs discussion** - the user is technically free but the meeting needs clarification

### Step 5: Check invitation responses

Review any invitation responses the user has received:

```bash
spark emails Inbox --filter "category:invitation_response"
```

Report who accepted, declined, or proposed alternative times.

## Tips

- Process invitations daily - they're time-sensitive and forgetting one can mean missing an important meeting.
- Use `availability` to quickly check free slots rather than scanning through `events` manually.
- Invitation responses (`category:invitation_response`) are a separate category - check them to see who RSVPed.
- For recurring meeting invitations, read the thread to check if the pattern works long-term, not just the next occurrence.
- When there's a conflict, suggest an alternative time by checking `availability` around the proposed date.
- Combine with `recipe-schedule-meeting` when an invitation leads to rescheduling.
