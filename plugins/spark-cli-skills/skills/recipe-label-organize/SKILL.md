# Recipe: Label & Folder Organize

Organize emails using labels and folders. Attach project labels, detach incorrect ones, and move misfiled emails to the right location.

**Prerequisite:** Read the `use-spark` base skill for command reference and filter syntax.

**Access level required:** triage.

## Steps

### Step 1: Review current folder and label structure

```bash
spark folders
```

For a specific account:

```bash
spark folders user@example.com
```

Note the existing labels and their message counts. Identify labels that are empty or no longer relevant.

### Step 2: Identify emails that need labeling

Search for project-related or topic-related emails that should be labeled:

```bash
spark search "project name"
spark emails --filter "from:client@company.com newer_than:30d"
```

### Step 3: Attach labels

Add a label to an email without removing it from its current location:

```bash
spark action attachLabel <id> --folder "user@example.com:ProjectAlpha"
```

Label multiple emails in a batch:

```bash
spark action attachLabel <id1> --folder "user@example.com:ProjectAlpha"
spark action attachLabel <id2> --folder "user@example.com:ProjectAlpha"
```

### Step 4: Detach incorrect labels

Remove a label that was applied incorrectly:

```bash
spark action detachLabel <id> --folder "user@example.com:WrongLabel"
```

### Step 5: Move misfiled emails

Move emails to the correct folder:

```bash
spark action moveToFolder <id> --folder "user@example.com:Projects"
```

### Step 6: Verify

Browse the organized label to confirm the right emails are there:

```bash
spark emails user@example.com:ProjectAlpha
```

## Tips

- Use `folders` to discover the exact qualified names for labels (e.g., `user@gmail.com:MyLabel`).
- `attachLabel` adds a label without moving the email - the email stays in its current folder too. This is how Gmail labels work.
- `detachLabel` removes a label without moving the email elsewhere.
- `moveToFolder` physically moves the email to a different folder - use this for IMAP-style organization.
- For Gmail accounts, prefer `attachLabel`/`detachLabel` over `moveToFolder` since Gmail uses labels rather than folders.
- Shared inbox labels use the format `shared@company.com:LabelName` or `"Team Name:LabelName"`.
- Combine with `recipe-meeting-prep` or project tracking workflows to label threads as part of a larger process.
- Run this recipe periodically to keep project labels current as new related emails arrive.
