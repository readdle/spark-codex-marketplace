# Recipe: Schedule a Meeting

Find mutual availability with attendees and present time slot options for scheduling.

**Prerequisite:** Read the `use-spark` base skill for command reference and filter syntax.

**Access level required:** read-only.

## Steps

### Step 1: Look up attendee emails

```bash
spark contacts "attendee name"
```

Repeat for each attendee to get their email addresses.

### Step 2: Find mutual availability

For tomorrow:

```bash
spark availability --tomorrow --attendees alice@co.com,bob@co.com
```

For a specific date range:

```bash
spark availability --start 2026-04-10 --end 2026-04-11 --attendees alice@co.com,bob@co.com
```

For the full week:

```bash
spark availability --week --attendees alice@co.com,bob@co.com
```

### Step 3: Present the options

List the available time slots for the user to choose from. Include:
- Date and time range for each slot
- Duration of each slot (so the user knows if a 1-hour meeting fits)

### Step 4: Narrow down if needed

If no slots work, try a broader window:

```bash
spark availability --start 2026-04-10 --end 2026-04-14 --attendees alice@co.com,bob@co.com
```

Or check individual availability to find who's blocking:

```bash
spark availability --start 2026-04-10 --end 2026-04-11 --attendees alice@co.com
spark availability --start 2026-04-10 --end 2026-04-11 --attendees bob@co.com
```

## Tips

- `availability` respects working hours (08:00-20:00) and skips weekends automatically.
- Events marked as "free" in the calendar are ignored - they don't block availability.
- Without `--attendees`, the command shows the user's own free time.
- For large groups, narrow the date range to get focused results.
- If the user provides names instead of emails, use `spark contacts` first to resolve them.
- The free slots are computed as mutual windows - times when all attendees and the user are available.
